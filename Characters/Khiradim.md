# Khiradim is the pre-eminent hero of Ashgnor. Just as Hercules(whom he is based off of) was of greek mythology, so will Khiradim be of this setting. 

# Born as a pre-mature baby, Khiradim was never supposed to live to adulthood. Among his peers, he was relentlessly bullied for his small stature and unimpressive physique. Seen as an outcast early in his life, he embraced his differences and resolved to make up what he lacked in brawn with brains.
